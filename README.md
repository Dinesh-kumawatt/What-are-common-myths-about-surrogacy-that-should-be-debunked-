# What-are-common-myths-about-surrogacy-that-should-be-debunked-

Surrogacy is often surrounded by misconceptions, and debunking these myths helps couples make informed decisions. One common myth is that surrogacy is only for infertile couples; in reality, it is also an option for same-sex couples, single parents, or individuals with medical conditions preventing pregnancy. Another misconception is that surrogates have limited rights or are exploited; reputable clinics in Ahmedabad follow strict ethical guidelines, legal contracts, and medical monitoring to ensure surrogate safety and consent. Some believe surrogacy guarantees a baby without risk, but pregnancy complications, embryo implantation failures, or multiple births can still occur. There is also a myth that surrogacy is morally or legally ambiguous, but India has clear regulations governing surrogacy, protecting the rights of intended parents and surrogates. Emotional attachment concerns are another area of misunderstanding; surrogates receive counseling to manage expectations, and legal agreements clarify parental rights. Educating oneself on these facts helps couples approach surrogacy confidently and responsibly, ensuring the process is safe, ethical, and fulfilling for both intended parents and surrogates. Modern surrogacy practices focus on transparency, legal compliance, and medical excellence, making it a viable path to parenthood for many.
